# My first Post

This is my first post to the page. It is also a test post to see if all the functions of making a publishing a post are working...

```python
print('Hello World! ðŸ‘‹')
```

```ts
console.log("Hello World! ðŸ‘‹");
// Test Comment

const test = 0;

function testFunc(hello: string) {
  return hello;
}
```

```java
system.out.println("Hello World! ðŸ‘‹")
```
