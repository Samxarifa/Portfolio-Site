## My first Post

This is my first post to the page. It is also a test post to see if all the functions of making a publishing a post are working...
This page was made with SvelteKit and TypeScript. It also uses MDsveX for markdown support as well as Shiki for syntax highlighting code blocks.

---

## Typescript Code Example

This is an example of a code block with syntax highlighting

```ts
// Check if theme is stored in browser storage
const theme = localStorage.getItem("theme");

if (theme) {
    // Apply theme
    document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
}
```

This is code for this website to check for manual light or dark mode on page load.
