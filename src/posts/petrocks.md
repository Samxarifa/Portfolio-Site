## College Project

This is a PHP eCommerce website that I was tasked to design, implement and test for college. It has all the functionality of a basic eCommerce site, such as:

-   Account register and login
-   Searching products and adding them to a cart
-   Checking out with discounts based on account tier (The way the tier was determined was not implemented)
-   Updating stock records appropriately, including out of stock

It was originally for HNC but I was required to expand upon it with new functionality such as media queries and an admin page for HND. The only functionality it doesn't have is a payment processor.
